## Introduction 
The WAEC Prep Arena Test game is the second portfolio project developed as part of the Code Instituteâ€™s Full-Stack Software Development Diploma course. This web-based, interactive test utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a front-end experience.

The game is specifically designed for students preparing for public examinations administered by the West African Examination Council (WAEC). It is particularly useful for Junior and Senior Secondary school students preparing for the Basic Education Certificate Examination (BECE) and the West African Senior Secondary Certificate Examination (WASSCE). However, it is also open to anyone interested in testing their knowledge in selected subjects.

The test is divided into two levels: Junior Secondary School (JSS) and Senior Secondary School (SSS), with four subjects available at each level. Each subject contains 15 questions, and each question offers four possible answers. Users are expected to select the correct answer within one minute. Upon completing the test, users are provided with a review of the questions, showing their selected answers alongside the correct ones to aid in learning.

A leaderboard displays each user's total score at the end of the test.

## Design

### Color Scheme
Shades of blue were chosen as the primary colors for the website due to their association with confidence and intelegence. The color palette, shown in the image below, was generated using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) tool.

The colour selection for the main features of the website is as follows:
  * #003366 was used for the background of the web pages.
  * #66CCFF was used as the primary colour for the buttons.
  * #007BFF was applied as the background color for popup windows and the test section.
  * #FFFFFF was used for the H1 elements and icons.
  * #000000 was used for H2, H3 and paragraph elements.
  * #008000 was used for the time bar.

### Typography
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to find an appropiate font family and generate and import the necessary code. Robot and san-serif fonts were selected as the primary font family for the website due to the readability and professional appearance.
